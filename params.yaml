f1_threshold: 0.7 # Save model as ONNX only if the evaluation test_f1 is greater than the f1_threshold
# Baseline F1 Score - if the evaluation test_f1 is less than the f1_threshold then the model is considered as underperforming, otherwise it is considered as overperforming and the model is considered as good. We will save the model only if the evaluation test_f1 is greater than the f1_threshold. Model will be saved as ONNX format. The saved model will be used in production.
